#This exercise is Part 3 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1 and Part 2.
#
#You can start your Python journey anywhere, but to finish this exercise you will have to have finished 
# Parts 1 and 2 or use the solutions (Part 1 and Part 2).
#
#In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect 
# guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
#
#In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing 
# the letter and displaying that information to the user. In this exercise, we have to put it all together and 
# add logic for handling guesses.
#
#Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:
#
#    Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
#    Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize 
# them - let them guess again.
#
#Optional additions:
#
#    When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
#    Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman. 
#      This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!
#
#Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help you!
