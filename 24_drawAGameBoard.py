#This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.
#
#Time for some fake graphics! Let’s say we want to draw game boards that look like this:
#
# --- --- --- 
#|   |   |   | 
# --- --- ---  
#|   |   |   | 
# --- --- ---  
#|   |   |   | 
# --- --- --- 
#
#This one is 3x3 (like in tic tac toe). Obviously, they come in many other sizes (8x8 for chess, 19x19 for Go, and many more).
#
#Ask the user what size game board they want to draw, and draw it for them to the screen using Python’s print statement.
#
#Remember that in Python 3, printing to the screen is accomplished by
#
#  print("Thing to show on screen")
#
#Hint: this requires some use of functions, as were discussed previously on this blog and elsewhere on the Internet, like this TutorialsPoint link.
