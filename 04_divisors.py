#Exercise 4 (and Solution)
#
#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Please provide a number: "))

print(list(filter(lambda d: True if number%d==0 else False, range(number,0,-1))))
