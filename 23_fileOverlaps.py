#Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list 
# of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
#
#(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real 
# thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
