# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
#
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the 
# SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is 
# Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line 
# in the file contains a single word.
#
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

def pickWord(dictFile):
    from random import choice

    with open(dictFile,'r') as dictFromFile:
        content = dictFromFile.readlines()

    return choice(content).strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(pickWord('./30_pickWord.txt'))
